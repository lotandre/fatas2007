    <p>{% blocktrans %}You will continue earning the same number of points as in the Start period until you draw a red card. In this case, the round ends.
        If you draw the red card before your <b>Start</b> period, you will earn zero.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}<b>Example</b>: Suppose that at the beginning of a round you chose to
        <b>Start</b> receiving a Payoff on Period 8.
        Suppose also that you draw green cards until Period 9 and at the end of Period 10 you draw a red card.
        In this case, you would earn zero in Period 1 to 7 (because you chose to Start receiving Payoffs in Period 8).
        In period 8, you earn 42 points (see table above). In period 9 and 10, while you are still active,
        you continue earning 42 points.
        In Period 11 you earn zero, since at the end of Period 10 you draw the red card and the round ended.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
