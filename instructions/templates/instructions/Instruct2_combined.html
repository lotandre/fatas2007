    <p>{% blocktrans %}For the Start period you will receive the Payoff and the one-time Payoff bonus for that period.
        You will continue earning the same number of points as in the Start period (but no bonus) until you draw a red card.
        In this case, the round ends.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}<b>Example</b>: Suppose that at the beginning of a round you chose to
        <b>Start</b> receiving a Payoff on Period 8.
        Suppose also that you draw green cards until Period 9 and at the end of Period 10 you draw a red card.
        In this case, you would earn zero on Period 1 to 7 (because you chose to Start receiving Payoffs in Period 8).
        In period 8, you earn 23 points as a Payoff and 85 points as a one-time Payoff bonus.
        In Period 9, you will earn 23 points (see table above).
        In period 10, you will earn 23 points again since you are still active.
        In Period 11 you earn zero, since at the end of Period 10 you draw the red card and exit the round.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
